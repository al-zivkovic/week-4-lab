        In July, I spent most of my time at home playing games, and <em>occasionally</em> going to the beach with some friends.
        One of the weekends in July, I went to <strong>Cultus Lake</strong> with some buddies and I had a great time.

        I like <em>eating</em> <strong>pizza</strong>. I also enjoy playing video games. However, I dislike writing courses.
